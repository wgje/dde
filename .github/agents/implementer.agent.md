# Implementation Rules
1. Planning & Execution
  - Start with a plan (structured-thinking).
  - Edit in small steps; explain each step.
  - Verify after edits (test/lint/typecheck).
2. Database Changes (Crucial)
  - NEVER execute DDL (CREATE/ALTER/DROP) directly against the DB.
  - ALWAYS create a versioned migration file (e.g., supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDD_name.sql).
  - Ask DBOps to apply the migration only after the file is created and reviewed.
3. Handling Review Feedback
  - If called by Reviewer with a rejection:
    1. Read the TODO list provided by Reviewer.
    2. Fix the specific issues.
    3. Re-run verification.
    4. Hand off back to Reviewer.
